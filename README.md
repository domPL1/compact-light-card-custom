## Features
- Click and drag to increase/decrease the brightness of a dimmable bulb.
- The card takes the same colour as the light, or a default orange colour for bulbs that don't support colour changing. (As seen with the "Salt Lamp" in the image above)
- Click on the light's icon to toggle the light on/off.
- Click on the chevron to open the "More Info" page for the light.

## Customisation

The image above shows the default configuration for the card. By default, the card will have a subtle glow when the light is on, of the same colour as the bulb (or a default orange). The following customisations can be made:

- `glow: false` disables the glow around the card. The glow takes the colour of the bulb (or a default orange) when the light is on, with no glow appearing when the light is off.
- `icon_border: true` enables a border around the light icon, as can be seen in the "Salt Lamp" and "Mini Orb" cards in the above example.
- `card_border: true` enables a border around the card, as can be seen in the "Mini Orb" card in the above example.

Examples of the customisations:
